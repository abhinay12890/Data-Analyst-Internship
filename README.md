# Data Analyst Internship Projects — Portfolio (2025)

This repository contains a curated collection of data analytics projects completed during my Data Analyst Internship (recreated using non-confidential/sample datasets).  
It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebooks and Tableau dashboards across finance, e-commerce, entertainment, travel, manufacturing, logistics, and public-safety domains.

Each project demonstrates:

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization & Insight Generation  
- Feature Engineering for ML readiness  
- Tableau Dashboards for business reporting  
- Python-based analytics workflows (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
